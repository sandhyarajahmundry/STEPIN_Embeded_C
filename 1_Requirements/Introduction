## Introduction
This system presents a Microcontroll(atmega328) based Seat measurement system to dectect and confirm the presence/absence of person on the seat. In this system the sensor will sense is the driver has been seated or not and if the driver seated then the temperature need to be set accordingly. Based on the controller it will set the temperature and it is capable of maintaining of heat in the vehicles seats. And whatever the heat is generated that point it will be displaying on displays like (Liquid crystal display (LCD),Light emitting diode (LED) backlit LCD, 
Thin film Transistors (TFT) LCD).

## Features
This system is reliable.
It is compitable.
It sense whether the person is existed or not.
low cost and robust system

## SWOT Analysis
## Strength
Low Cost.
Modular based program.
## Weekness
It can be used only in europian countries.
## Opportunities
It can be implemented by replacing heater by air conditioner so that it can be helpful in all the countries.
## Threates
It will not suitable in high temperature Environment.
